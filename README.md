# Triangle

### Overview
This is a simple Java graphics project that allows users to plot 4 points on the screen. The program draws the triangle that is formed after the user plots the first 3 points (triangle vertices). Once this is done, the user can plot the 4th point. Once the user plots the 4th point, the program indicates whether the 4th point is located inside the triangle, outside the triangle, or on one of the edges of the triangle. Note that the the triangle vertices remained fixed once they have been plotted, but the 4th point can be adjusted by clicking on different locations on the screen. If the user wishes to redraw the triangle, then the user can click the "Quit" button on the screen, restart the program, and finally redraw the triangle.
